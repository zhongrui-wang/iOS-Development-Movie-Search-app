# iOS-Development-Movie Search app
Movie data will be pulled from TMDB API. Navigation bars, tab bars, table views and collection views are built-in ways to structure app’s content. I use different view controllers to displayed top-rated movies, most recent movies, search page, movie detail page and favorites. Users should be able to search for movies in the search page, see the results populated in a collection view, and each cell contains the movie poster. Click on certain cell to view more details including title, poster, rate, overview, trailer, twitter. For trailer and twitter, by using the provided trailer API, I use a button to lead into watching the trailer on YouTube app or open the trailer on YouTube's webpage through safari, judged by whether one’s iPhone has YouTube or not. Same as Twitter. And for the favorites, I use a button in different movie’s detail to save it to UserDefaults as favorites and favorite movies will be shown in the favorite page.
